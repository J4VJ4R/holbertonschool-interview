### Description

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of 
well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing,
automated reasoning, and other tasks.
