### Description

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of 
well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing,
automated reasoning, and other tasks.

### Resources 


>Read or watch

- [ Python Language Leer de stdin](https://riptutorial.com/es/python/example/12984/leer-de-stdin)

### Learning Objectives

- Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>
After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning:
Total file size: File size: <total size>
where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size> (see input format above)
Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesn’t appear, don’t print anything for this status code
format: <status code>: <number>
status codes should be printed in ascending order
