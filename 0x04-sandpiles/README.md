### Description

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of 
well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing,
automated reasoning, and other tasks.

### Learning Objectives

- Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles
  
  Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
  You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
  A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
  When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
  grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
  You’re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
### Technologies
